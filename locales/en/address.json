Several types of coverage exist, from smart contract hacks to phishing attacks. We've partnered with <fairside-link>Fairside</fairside-link> to offer you coverage in case of some phishing and social engineering drains, but other coverage products exist for smart contract hacks, such as <nexus-link>Nexus Mutual</nexus-link> or <bright-union-link>Bright Union</bright-union-link>.",
